      <p>I am John Cely.</p>
      <p>
        I am a software developer with 7+ years of experience working with java and
        angular, and most recently with go and react.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love coding, that's my hobby and my job, and I do it in the best way Iâ€™m able
        to, keeping code clean, readable, with meaningful tests, and split into small
        pieces that make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently work as a fullstack engineer at Twilio, where, along with my 3 people
        team, we tackle most of software development cicle: write proposals that address
        product requirements and technical needs, plan the implementation of those
        proposals by creating and prioritizing user stories, develop, test and deploy the
        applications, and support them in case of any type of service degradation.
